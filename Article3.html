		<h2>Cluas Éireann</h2>
		<h3>Bringing you the latest music updates from Ireland</h3>
		<br>
		<h3>Who to look 4, 2019</h3>
		<h4>Top 4 up-and-coming music artists in Ireland</h4>
		<br>
		<p>The music scene in Ireland has been absolutely booming lately and we want to keep an eye (and ear) out for the latest talent and who 
		we think might just become a household name by next year.</p>
		<p>The range of musicians and the music they play is incredibly diverse. 
		From Rap, Pop, Punk, Electronics and various sub-genres of Indie being played there is 
		just so much talent to choose from.</p>
		<p>With that that said here is Cluas Éireann’s 4 acts to look out for:</p>
		<p>1.	Wild Youth.</p>
		<p>Wild Youth are a four-piece from Dublin currently enjoying a breakthrough year with their hit single "Can't Move On". 
		With a sound very reminiscent of “Maroon 5” and “the 1975” they play a melodic brand of pop-rock full of electronic touches. 
		They have supported artists such as Niall Horan and Kodaline and have recently sold out their first Irish tour. They have just 
		played their biggest ever headline show in Dublin's Olympia Theatre on the 23rd March.</p>
		<p>2.	Tebi Rex</p>
		<p>An alternative hip-hop duo whose style can fluctuate from catchy, upbeat pop to dark and complex lyricism, Tebi Rex are leading the 
		charge to bring the home-grown urban scene to a wider audience.</p>
		<p>Their breakthrough track “She Hated Love Songs II” acted as social critique of unrealistic standards about what love looks and acts like.</p>
		<p>A succession of career high points since has included their debut EP arriving to huge acclaim, follow up “Peggy's Bus” scoring a 
		radio hit in Ireland, festival appearances at Longitude, Electric Picnic and Indiependence and collaborations with The Blizzards and Eve Belle. 
		Their first album is due in 2019.</p>
		<p>3.	Fia Moon</p>
		<p>Growing up, Fia trained classically and began performing from the age of 5. She was influenced by her parents who were also jazz and 
		classical musicians and grew up listening to the likes of Ella Fitzgerald and Frank Sinatra.</p>
		<p>She issued her debut release 'The Fall' early last year, which describes her longing for a sense of home. She then signed an independent 
		record deal which saw her release 3 back to back tracks between August and late October to much critical acclaim.
		Her releases were premiered by the likes of CLASH magazine and EARMILK and she has been dubbed as one to watch by the Official UK Charts Company.</p>
		<p>4.	Fontaines D.C.</p>
		<p>Fontaines D.C. are an Irish punk band that has been making a name for themselves recently. With an unmistakably Irish lead singer and 
		lyrics that often read like passages of some manifesto these lads are causing quite the stir.  Their songs Chequeless Reckless, Too Real 
		and Boys in a Better Land have already racked up hundreds of thousands of listeners and they have performed on tour throughout mainland 
		Europe, Iceland and all over Britain and Ireland.</p>
		<p>The 5 man band is based in Dublin and the essence of Dublin permeates their music expressing, seemingly simultaneously, 
		a romanticism of and disgust with many aspects of modern Irish life. 
		Always there in their lyrics is the question of what does it mean to be an Irishman now?</p>
		<p>Certainly ones to watch for the future.</p>
