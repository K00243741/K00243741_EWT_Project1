		<h2>Cluas Éireann</h2>
		<h3>Bringing you the latest music updates from Ireland</h3>
		<br>
		<h3>New album by Hozier</h3>
		<h4>After years without a release Irish legend Hozier has released another fantastic album</h4>
		<br>
		<p>The ever-fantastic Hozier (real name Andrew Hozier-Byrne) released his newest album “Wasteland, Baby” this month and reception to it has already been great for the Wicklow native.</p>
		<p>This has been a long awaited release with the EP Nina Cried Power released back in September, 2018.</p>
		<p>The title track of the EP takes inspiration from other artists who have been heavily involved in social 
		activism and the fight against human rights abuses, named after American jazz and blues legend Nina Simone, 
		but also referencing artists like Bob Dylan and Mavis Staples.</p>
		<p>Continuing on his campaign of spreading social change through music Nina Cried Power has been described as a “love letter to the spirit of activism”. 
		Hozier has always had powerful messages in his songs, from spreading awareness on the dangers of isolation on mental health, spousal abuse in his song 
		“Cherry Wine” and most famously his hit song “Take Me to Church”, the video of which depicted the anti-gay violence in Russia. 
		This song also propelled Andrew into the international spotlight as well, by playing an instrumental role in Ireland’s marriage equality referendum, 
		being on the front page of Reddit and after being shared by Stephen Fry. Other important public figures have also commented on his newest work, with former American president 
		Barack Obama labelling Nina Cried Power as one of his favourite songs of 2018.</p>
		<p>Andrew believes that part of the reason for his involvement in the fight for social justice is because of his childhood growing up in a Quaker family. 
		The Quakers have often been at the forefront of many civil rights fights, being among the first group within the Christian 
		tradition to accept gay rights and equal education for men and women.</p>
		<p>His upbringing has also been very important for his direction towards music. 
		His father, John Byrne, was a blues drummer in Bray, Wicklow and his mother, Raine Hozier-Byrne, was an artist. 
		He had been encouraged to follow his talent for music, having written songs ever since he was 15. 
		It was though his father that he developed his taste for American blues, gospel music and jazz – 
		many elements of which can be heard incorporated into his work.</p>
		<p>With the release of the album he will be going on tour throughout America and Europe to support the album. 
		He will also be headlining Electric Picnic 2019 and is scheduled to perform at the Glastonbury Festival 2019 too. 
		He is also scheduled to perform at the Lollapalooza 2019, a four-day music festival held in Chicago in August.</p>
