		<h3>Bringing you the latest music updates from Ireland</h3>
		<br>
		<h3>Tech and Music</h3>
		<h4>A brief look at whether or not the influence of technology on the music industry
		has been a positive or a negative</h4>
		<br>
		<p>It is no secret that musicians in Ireland (and indeed the world over) have horrendously 
		difficult time trying to make a name for themselves on Ireland’ s music circuit. 
		Finding an interested party to play with has become quite the difficult task in and 
		of itself for many young people, however with modern technologies, there are plenty 
		of tools to help young people connect and with others and get the word out.</p>
		<p>Traditionally, when a band was trying to break into the spotlight they had to 
		start from the lowest rungs of the music circuit. They could spend years playing pubs, 
		small clubs and other similar venues to get limited recognition, but with lots of luck 
		and lots of work they, and perhaps the style they carried, they would eventually break 
		through. Their fellow competitors were living the exact same lifestyle and though the 
		scuffles of the older generation of musicians have become somewhat infamous, there was 
		still an element of camaraderie between these musical pioneers.</p>
		<p>Nowadays that sense of camaraderie seems to have disappeared; certainly it has been 
		weakened anyway. And instead we have a musical landscape full of loneliness, clearly reflected 
		in much of the independent music produced today. And quite possibly, just like how social media
		sites have seemingly increased social isolation, so too have music streaming technologies and the
		general pervasiveness of formulaic pop nonsense reduced the real soul that lies in creating music.</p>
		<p>But if the rising influence of technology within the music industry has been a cause, could it
		also be a solution? Certainly, one can look at the rather unique rise of Dermot Kennedy, breaking
		onto the American music scene more strongly than in Ireland. The reason, he believes, is because 
		of his Spotify account, which gave him thousands of hits and a lucky break. There have also been 
		a notable amount of YouTube sensations that start off merely singing into a camera that have garnered
		millions of fans. New social media sites like Down-Beat to Up-Beat could also play an, pardon the pun,
		instrumental role in revitalising the almost formulaic so-called independent music infesting Ireland 
		today, especially in the college environments around Ireland.</p>
		<p>The great hope of all these new technologies is that they are simply complimentary to the
		existing structures, but we have seen the existing structures get ripped apart before us and 
		disappear entirely. I do not know if that will be the case with the new additions to Irish music
		but we’ll see. Eventually something has to come out on top. Whether or not it is for better or 
		for worse is the big question</p>
