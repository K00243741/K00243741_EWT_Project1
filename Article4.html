		<h2>Cluas Éireann</h2>
		<h3>How you can get tickets to Ireland's biggest music festival</h3>
		<br>
		<h3>Electric Picnic, 2019</h3>
		<h4>Detailing Dermot Kennedy's success abroad and it's unusual nature</h4>
		<br>
		<p>All tickets for Electric Picnic 2019 is not running until 30 August but tickets for the massive festival have already been sold out in record time.</p>
		<p>The annual music festival, held in Stradbally Hall, Co. Laois, is by far one of the biggest annual events in Ireland and a brilliant experience for all. 
		With various activities for its participants to enjoy, from comedy, a swimming area and most importantly the various areas to be drenched in the different 
		music styles at the festival it is an awesome experience.</p>
		<p>This year’s line-up is fantastic, with names like Hozier, Billie Eilish, Florence and the Machine, the Strokes, Dermot Kennedy and much, much more 
		there is no way you will want to miss out on it this Summer.</p>
		<P>So if you don’t have a ticket, what can you do?</p>
		<p>Well, fortunately for all the athletes out there (and those that want it bad enough), there is a way. 2019’s Tour de Picnic is still selling tickets 
		to those interested. The Picnic, sponsored by Irish Dairy, involves either a 17km run (tickets for this event have been sold out) or an 80km cycle. 
		Still accepting!) Money made from the event will be going to 3 charities this year – LauraLynn Children’s Hospice, Ronald McDonald House and ISPCC Childline. 
		All participants will gain entry into Electric Picnic for their endeavours and will free milk along the route to keep them going. Each individual must raise 
		a minimum of €395 and €60 initial deposit.</p>
		<p>If you are feeling especially generous you can try the VIP challenge. The fundraising target is €1000 but this also comes with free space to pitch a 
		tent and exclusive guest area access. People engaging in the VIP challenge can do the 17km run instead of the 80km cycle. So if you are up for the challenge 
		and want to go to the biggest music festival in Ireland this year, why not give it a try?</p>
		<br>
		<p>"We're very excited to bring Tour de Picnic to the next level for its eleventh year. The event has grown every year, in 2019 over one thousand people will be taking part. 
		Irish Dairy, The Complete Natural will be offering nutrition tips and training plans to participants this year along. 
		The rest stops along the route have been upgraded and the Tour de Picnic Welcome Area at Electric Picnic will get everyone in the party vibe. 
		The Electric Picnic Lineup for 2019 is exceptional. I'm delighted to welcome LauraLynn Children’s Hospice, ISPCC Childline and Ronald McDonald 
		House Charity as our 2019 charity partners. We're offering VIP and Corporate packages into the mix this year to bring fundraising to new heights 
		for these three worthy causes. I would like to thank Festival Republic and all our partners for helping us make this event happen every year." Brian McDermott - Organiser</p>
